        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a Calorie Burn Prediction System developed using Flask, Python, and machine learning. Users can input personal and activity details through a user-friendly HTML and CSS interface. The system processes this data and predicts the number of calories burned based on trained ML models. It aims to help users monitor their fitness progress and make informed decisions about their health and exercise routines. The web application is easy to use and provides quick, accurate results.

        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>üìå Project Description: Calories Burn Prediction System

The Calories Burn Prediction System is a machine learning‚Äìbased project designed to estimate the number of calories a person burns during physical activities. It takes into account factors such as gender, age, height, weight, duration of exercise, heart rate, and body temperature to make predictions.

This system helps users monitor their fitness progress, design better workout routines, and understand how their body responds to different types of exercise. Unlike general fitness apps that show average values, this system provides personalized calorie burn predictions using trained models.

‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

The user inputs their details (e.g., age, gender, height, weight).

They provide activity-related values (duration, heart rate, body temperature).

The machine learning model processes these inputs.

The system predicts the number of calories burned.

‚úÖ Example

Suppose Rahul, a 25-year-old male (height: 175 cm, weight: 70 kg), does 30 minutes of jogging with an average heart rate of 140 bpm and body temperature of 38¬∞C.

Input:

Age: 25

Gender: Male

Height: 175 cm

Weight: 70 kg

Duration: 30 minutes

Heart Rate: 140 bpm

Body Temperature: 38¬∞C

Output (Prediction):

Calories Burned ‚âà 280 kcal

This prediction allows Rahul to track his progress and adjust his diet/exercise plan accordingly.

üåü Key Features

Personalized calorie burn predictions.

Supports different activity types.

Can be integrated with fitness apps or smart devices.

Useful for athletes, fitness trainers, and health-conscious individuals.</p>
